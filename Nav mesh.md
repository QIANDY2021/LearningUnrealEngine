# Nav mesh

A Nav Mesh is created by enclosing the part of the level that should have a Nav Mesh with a Nav Mesh Bounds Volume.
When the Nav Mesh Bounds Volume has been placed the engine will build navigation data.
The building is triggered from Tool Bar > Build > Navigation > Build Paths.
The Nav Mesh is visualized in green when pressing 'P'.

There is also a runtime Nav Mesh system, where a local Nav Mesh is generated around select Actors.
