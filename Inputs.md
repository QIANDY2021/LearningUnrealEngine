# Inputs

Inputs are named events that the user can trigger and that Blueprints listen for.
They are created in the Project Settings, the Engine â†’ Input category.
There are Action Mappings and Axis mappings.
Action mappings are one-off binary pressed/released events, like keys and buttons.
Axis mappings are continuous both in time and value, like thumbstics and joysticks.
We can bind many keys/sticks to each mapping, i.e., we can have several buttons for "jump".
We can bind keys and buttons to axis mappings and set a scale that can be negative.
This makes it possible to have keyboard fallback for events that are usually continuous.

We can also bind low-level inputs directly, i.e., create keyboard, mouse, and gamepad event nodes.
In an Actor's Event Graph, right-click and select something from the Gamepad or Keyboard categories.
These low-level events must be enabled in an actor by calling Enable Input, passing in Get Player Controller, in BeginPlay.

Some Components have build-in events that can be added to a Blueprints event graph.
Select a Component in the Components panel in the Blueprint Editor and scroll the Details panel down to the Events category.
Click the `+` next to the event you want.
It is not possible to create these events when multiple Components are selected.
