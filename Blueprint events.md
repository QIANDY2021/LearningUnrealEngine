## Blueprint events

Events mark the starting point of a Visual Script execution.
Events are red nodes that have an output execution pin.
Some events have output data pins as well.
Events are triggered as a response to things happening elsewhere in the system.
The flow of control follows the execution wire from the event's execution pin from execution node to execution node, evaluating the required expression nodes as it goes.
