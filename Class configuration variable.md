# Class configuration variable

A class configuration variable is a variable that is visible in the Details Panel when an object is selected in the Level Viewport.
The level designer can manipulate these variables to configure the selected object and immediately see the results.
This is accomplished by creating a regular variable, checking the Instance Editable checkbox, and creating nodes in the Construction Script to do the necessary changes/configuration to the Blueprint class instances to achive the desired effect.
The Construction Script is executed when anything changes in the Blueprint class while in the Unreal Editor.
