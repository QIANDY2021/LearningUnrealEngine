# Build systems

Project files for several build systems can be generated for a project.
On Windows people seem to generally use Visual Studio.
On Linux there is a bit more variability.
Project files are generated by running the `GenerateProjectFiles.sh` script.
It's located in the root of the Unreal Engine working copy.
Pass it the path to the `.uproject` file and parameters controlling how and for what to generate project files.
Example:
```
./GenerateProjectFiles.sh <PATH>/<PROJECT>.uproject -game -Makefile -CMakefile
```
The above will generate a `Makefile` and a `CMakeLists.txt` in `<PATH>`,

Unreal Engine 4.25 introduced a warning when passing project type parameters on the command line.
Recommends setting these in `BuildConfiguration.xml` instead.
On Linux this file is at `~/.config/Unreal Engine/UnrealBuildTool/`.
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<Configuration xmlns="https://www.unrealengine.com/BuildConfiguration">
  <ProjectFileGenerator>
    <Format>Make</Format>
    <Format>CMake</Format>
  </ProjectFileGenerator>
</Configuration>
```
This doesn't work.
