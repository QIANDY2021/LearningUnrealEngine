# Projectile Movement Component

Used when a projectile should move "physics like".
A Component, so should be added to an Actor.
Important properties, set from the Details Panel, are:
- Initial speed.
- Rotation Follows Velocity.
- Projectile Gravity Scale.
Set to 0 to disable gravity, make the projectile fly in a straight line.

I think the Projectile Movement Component assume that X is forward, at least by default.
