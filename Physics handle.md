# Physics handle

> in your case you probably want to use a physics handle. It's a component that can grab on to physics bodies and move them around when it's moved
> 
> so the handle would be attached to your mesh at the hand socket, so it'll move around with the hand. You can tell the handle to grab something (your tree) and then it'll move it around when its moved
