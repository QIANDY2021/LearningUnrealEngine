## Installed Build

An engine Installed Build is an export of sorts from a source build to a distributable package that can be shared among developers on a team.


For Linux:
```
./Engine/Build/BatchFiles/RunUAT.sh
    BuildGraph
    -Target="Make Installed Build Linux"
    -Script=Engine/Build/InstalledEngineBuild.xml
    -Set:HostPlatformOnly=true
    -Set:WithDDC=false
    -Set:WithLinuxAArch64=false
    -Set:HostPlatformDDCOnly=false
    -Set:GameConfigurations=Development
    -Clean
```

For Windows (untested, just following the pattern):
```
RunUAT.bat BuildGraph
    -Target="Make Installed Build Win64"
    -Script=Engine/Build/InstalledEngineBuild.xml
    -Set:HostPlatformOnly=true
    -Set:WithDDC=false
    -Set:HostPlatformDDCOnly=false
    -Set:GameConfigurations=Development
    -Clean

```
The Installed Build is created at `<UE4Root>/LocalBuilds/Engine`.


Longer description:

There is a Build Graph script that creates an install version of Unreal Engine.
The script is `<UE4Root>/Engine/Build/InstalledBuild.xml`.
Run with
```
RunUAT BuildGraph -Target="Make Installed Build <PLATFORM>" -Script="Engine/Build/InstalledEngineBuild.xml" -Clean
```
Why the `-Clean` part?
Platform can be either `Win64`, `Mac`, or `Linux`.
The Installed Build is created at `<UE4Root>/LocalBuilds/Engine`.
Can be changed somehow, but the docs don't say how.

To build only for the host platform, pass `-Set:HostPlatformOnly=true`.
To disable Derived Data Cache build, pass `-Set:WithDDC=false`.
To select which configuration to build, pass `-Set:GameConfiguration=Development`.

The above command will produce a build that is quite large, 100 GiB or so.
The below is supposed to produce a smaller build, but I haven't tested yet. I don't see which part is supposed to make it smallerâ€¦
Perhaps not passing `Development` will exclude debug information. I _think_ that part was required to export/package plugins.
```
./Engine/Build/BatchFiles/RunUAT.sh BuildGraph
    -script=Engine/Build/InstalledEngineBuild.xml
    -target="Make Installed Build Linux"
    -nosign
    -set:HostPlatformEditorOnly=true
    -set:WithDDC=false
    -set:WithIOS=false
    -set:WithTVOS=false
    -set:WithMac=false
    -set:WithWin64=false
    -set:WithWin32=false
    -clean
```

Unreal Engine creates a Build ID for each build.
The Build ID prevents dynamic libraries from being used with the wrong build of the engine.
The purpose is to prevent stale and outdated dynamic libraries from being accidentally loaded, which is a common source of difficult-to-diagnose problems.
At build time a `.modules` JSON file is written to each output directory that has at least one compiled dynamic library.
This files lists the modules, their associated dynamic library, and the Build ID for the current build.
The `.modules` files should be included in binary releases of the engine.

## Null Source Code Accessor

Unreal Engine 4.25 had a bug on Linux where new C++ projects couldn't be created and projects not packaged unless the Clang system package was installed.
