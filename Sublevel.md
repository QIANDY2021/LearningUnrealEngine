# Sublevel

There is a Levels Panel that holds all the Sublevels for the currently open Persistent Level.
Sublevels are used for level streaming and organizational purposes.
It is common to have separate Sublevels for Game, Light, Sound, Environment, Geometry.
Can also split per location / geography.
Helps with collaboration.
The goal is to let different people work in different Sublevels, so split according to your team's need.

When using Sublevels for the different types of objects in the same location, set the Sublevel's streaming method to Always Loaded.
