# Build settings

The build settings for a module are specified in that module's `<module>.Build.cs` C# source file.

Somewhere around Unreal Engine 4.25 something changed regarding build settings.
Switch between the old and new one in the `.Target.cs` file:
```
DefaultBuildSettings = BuildSettingsVersion.V2;
```


The amount of parallelization when building with Unreal Build Tool is set in an XML configuration file.
`~/.config/Unreal Engine/UnrealBuildTool/BuildConfiguration.xml`
Changing it may require a full engine rebuild.
We can configure:
- `bUseUnityBuild` Default: true
    Whether to compile "all" source files in a Module (or Target?) at once or as separate compiler invocations per source file. Disabling this may make builds take longer, may revealing missing includes you didn't know about because includes no longer leak between source files.
- `bUsePCHFiles` Default: true
    Whether to use precompiled headers or not.

Disabling `bUseUnityBuild` and `bUsePCHFiles` may help with debugging since the debug information will then point to the actual source files and not files generated by the Unreal Build Tool.
