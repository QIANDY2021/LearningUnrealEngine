# Material Editor

The Material Editor is used to create Render Materials.
A Render Material is a Visual Scripting Graph that is run per-vertex and/or per-pixel.
It produces a set of outputs that are used by the Shading Model.
The result of the computation is written to the input pin of the main material node.
Which pins are active depend on the Shading Model that has been selected for the material.
The Shading Model is selected from the Details Panel when the main material node, or no node, is selected.
