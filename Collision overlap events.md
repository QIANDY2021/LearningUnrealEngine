# Collision overlap event

A collision event, also called an overlap event, is when one collision volume overlap another collision volume and the collision preset is set to `Overlap`.
Examples of collision volumes are Static Mesh (I think), Box Collision and Sphere Collision.

We can bind hook up Visual Scripting Graph Nodes to such events in a Blueprint.
