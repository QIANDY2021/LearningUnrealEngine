# Click events

Some Components have the `On Clicked` event.
Create an execution start node for it by Blueprint Editor > Components > Select your component > Details panel > Events category > `+` next to `On Clicked`.
This will create an `On Clicked (<Component Name>)` event node in the Blueprint's Event Graph.
