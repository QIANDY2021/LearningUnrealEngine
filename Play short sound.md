# Play short sound

Sounds can be played from a HUD class.
Create a new function in the HUD class called `Play<Something>Sound`.
Create a `PlaySound2D` node.
A 2D sound is one that has stereo channels but no 3D position in the world.
Select the imported sound asset from the drop-down next to the `Sound` input pin.
Call the `Play<Something>Sound` on the HUD instance whenever you want a sound to play.
