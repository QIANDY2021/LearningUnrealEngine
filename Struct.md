# Struct

A Struct is a collection of variables.
They can be created in C++ with the `USTRUCT` decorator and the `struct` keyword.
They can be created in Blueprint with Content Browser > Context Menu > Blueprint > Struct.

In a Blueprint Script individual members of the struct are set with the `Set Member In` node.
