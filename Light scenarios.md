# Light scenarios

A sublevel that (only?) contains light sources.
In the Levels Panel, right-click a Sublevel > Lighting Scenario > Change to Lighting Scenario.
Switch between Lighting scenario sublevels to change the lighting in the level.
Switch by hiding the current one and unhide the one you want.
Hiding and unhiding is done with the eye symbol next to each level in the Level Panel.
Don't know how to do it during runtime.

Light scenarios cannot be interpolated, it's a switch.
