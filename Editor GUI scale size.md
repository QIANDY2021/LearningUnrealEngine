# Editor GUI scale size

There is a DPI-aware checkbox in Top Menu Bar > Edit > Edit Preferences > Appearance > High DPI Awareness.
Checking this will make Unreal Editor guess how large the GUI elements in the editor should me.

The scale / size / DPI of the Unreal Editor GUI and Slate widgets can be set from the Widget Reflector.
Top Menu Bar > Windows > Developer Tools > Widget Reflector.
At the top of the Widget Reflector there is a slider named Application Scale.
