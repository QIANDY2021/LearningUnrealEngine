# Camera

A `Camera` is often added to a `Pawn` or a `Character`, but sometimes to the level.
Use a `Pawn` for a free-floating camera and `Character` for something that walks around.
A `Camera` is often attached via a `SpringArm`.
The `Pawn` that the `Camera` is attached to should be be the `Default Pawn Class` in the Game mode.

A camera can also be [stand-alone](./Stand-alone camera.md).
