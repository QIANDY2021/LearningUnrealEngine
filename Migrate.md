# Migrate

A migration is the act of moving an asset or a set of assets from from Unreal Engine project to another.
Will include all dependencies of the exported asset.
Maintains references and compatibility between engine versions.
Simply copying the files between projects may not work, especially when the projects use different versions of Unreal Engine.

Migrate an asset with Content Browser > right-click the asset > Asset Actions > Migrate.
A list of assets is opened. Click OK.
In the directory selection window that opens, select the Content directory of the target Unreal Engine project.
Don't select any other directory, select the Content.
