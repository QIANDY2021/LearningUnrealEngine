# Package project

A project is turned into a stand-alone executable by packaging.
The packaging process consists of several steps.
Some of them can be quite time consuming.

Start the packaging process by selecting
Top Menu Bar > File > Package Project > PLATFORM > PLATFORM VERSION.

Several of the Project Settings options influence the packaging process and result.

Project > Maps & Modes > Default Game Map
The map that will be the start map when launching the game.
It is common that this is some type of menu screen.

Project > Packaging
This section contains a lot of packaging related settings.
- Build Configuration
    Which configuration to build.
    Debug, DebugGame, Development, Test, and Shipping.

- For Distribution
    The tool tip says that enabling this will use the Shipping configuration.
    Disabling this will use the Development configuration.
    I don't know how this interacts with the Build Configuration selection.
