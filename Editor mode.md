# Editor mode

An editor mode is when the editor disables the regular click-to-select mode and instead performs some other operation.
For example landscape painting or Actor picking.

There may be some information at [Editor scripting tools plugin @ forums.unrealengine.com](https://forums.unrealengine.com/development-discussion/python-scripting/1837561-editor-scripting-tools-plugin).

We can create our own modes.
