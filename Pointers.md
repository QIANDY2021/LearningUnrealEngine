# Pointers

(
This entire note can perhaps be merged into [[2020-03-10_21:18:30]] [Memory management and smart pointers](./Memory%20management%20and%20smart%20pointers.md).

Write about `UPROPERTY` pointers to UObject, TWeakObjectPtr, automatic nulling, reference counting of `UPROPERTY` pointers, pointers to assets becoming `nullptr` when the asset it deleted from the Content Browser.
