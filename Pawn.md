# Pawn

A `Pawn` is a type of Actor that can be controlled.
By a player with a controller, or by an AI.
Can be a character, a vehicle, a fish, etc.
A simple player controlled `Pawn` is created from a `StaticMesh`, a `SpringArm`, and a `Camera`.
Attach the `SpringArm` to the `StaticMesh` and the `Camera` to the `SprintArm`.
Position and rotate the `StaticMesh` until you get the view point you want.
The `StaticMesh` is often a sphere.
I don't know what the purpose of the `StaticMesh` is.
