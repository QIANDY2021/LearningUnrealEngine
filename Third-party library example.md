# Third-party library example

This page describe a complete third-party library integration into an Unreal Engine plugin.
The library is a simple mock library that has a dependency of its own, makes use of C++ classes, exceptions, and runtime type information in the headers, and uses functions from both the C and C++ standard libraries, both in inline functions in the header files and in the source files.
