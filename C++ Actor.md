# C++ Actor

This is a minimal templates for a C++ Actor called MyActor.

Create `MyActor.h` in the target module's `Public` directory.
Create `MyActor.cpp` in the target module's `Private` directory.


`MyActor.h`:
```cpp
// This is an include guard, to prevent the heade file's content from being included
// multiple times in a single translational unit.
#pragma once

// This gives access to the basics of Unreal Engine.
#include "CoreMinimal.h"

// We'll be inheriting from the AActor class, so we need its definition.
#include "GameFramework/Actor.h"

// Every header file that contains classes deriving from Unreal Engine classes
// get a corresponding .generated.h file, which must be included in the header
// file and it must be the last #include.
#include "FirstActor.generated.h"

// UCLASS is used to mark the following class as an Unreal Engine class. One may
// add class specifiers inside the parenthesis. This mark is required for the
// reflection system to pick up the class.
UCLASS()
// All classes that inherit from AActor must prefix their name with A.
class AFirstActor : public AActor
{
public:
    // GENERATED_BODY is a macro that is generated by Unreal Header Tool and is
    // defined in the corresponding .generated.h file.
	GENERATED_BODY()
};
```

[[2020-12-30_17:24:55]] [Class specifiers](./Class%20specifiers.md)  

`MyActor.cpp`:
```cpp
#include "FirstActor.h"
```

The above is enough to build and use the Actor, but it doesn't do much.
Create an instance by dragging it from Content Browser > C++ Classes into the level.
It doesn't even have a Root Component so nothing is shown, not even the white marker sphere.
This Actor doesn't have a position.
It will show up in the World Outliner.

The following is an example which uses a few more features.

`MyActor.h`:
```cpp
#pragma once

#include "CoreMinimal.h"
#include "GameFramework/Actor.h"

#include "FirstActor.generated.h"

UCLASS()
class AFirstActor : public AActor
{
public:
	GENERATED_BODY()
    
    virtual void Tick(float DeltaTime) override;
    virtual void BeginPlay() override;
};

```

`MyActor.cpp`:
```cpp
#include "MyActor.h"

AMyActor::AMyActor()
{
    // By setting bCanEverTick to true we request that the Tick callback is called.
    // This comes with a performance penaly, so try to avoid it.
    PrimaryActorTick.bCanEverTick = true;
}

void AMyActor::Tick(float DeltaTime)
{
    Super::Tick(DeltaTime);
    
    // Do your per-tick work here.
}

void AMyActor::BeginPlay()
{
    Super::BeginPlay();
}
```
