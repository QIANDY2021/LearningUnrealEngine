# Dynamic material

A Material that can be changed during runtime. I think.
Could also be one that is created at runtime.
Is created for a `StaticMesh` by calling `Create Dynamic Material Instance`.
A Dynamic Material is created from a Material Instance.
The Material Instance should have at least one parameter 
The parameter is set on the Dynamic Material using `Set Vector Parameter Value`.
The name of the parameter must be known/hard-coded. Case sensitive.
