# Export

Unreal Editor can export assets in many of the formats that it can import.

To export a single asset:  
Content Browser > right-click asset > Asset Actions > Export.…

To export the objects selected in the Level Editor viewport:  
Level Editor > Top Menu Bar > Export Selected…

To export the entire level:
Level Editor > Top Menu Bar > Export All.…

If you want to move assets between Unreal Engine projects then use migrate instead of export.
A migrate will maintain references between the assets.
