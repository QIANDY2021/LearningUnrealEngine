Non-dynamic ligting must be built.
This is done from the Main Tool Bar.

Some types of lights can be either be inverse square falloff or not.
Inverse square falloff is more realistic but requires large luminance and radius values.
Linear square falloff (which I assume the alternative is) can be easier to control.
